== Description ==

Very basic and simple plugin to monitor uptime. Performance monitoring is done from external servers. Operating status is displayed in WordPress and can also be viewed (in more detail) on the external server. The user will get an email when the website is down.

== Installation ==

WebOnMo can be installed by uploading the zip file or install it from the plugin repository inside the WordPress admin. Once installed, click ’Activate Plugin’ to finish the installation.

After installing and activating the plugin, got to ’Settings -> WebOnMo Plugin’ and follow step 1-4 to connect to the (external) monitoring service.

NOTE: This plugin uses external servers to check your website uptime, since if your site is down we could not detect it if your own server were to check your own website. Registering at webonmo.com is therefore required.
